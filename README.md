Welcome to the Music Generation project! 

This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to generate music sequences based on input data. 

ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can generate music by predicting the next note in a sequence. The project involves the following steps:

- Loading and Preprocessing Data: Load music note sequences from text files, preprocess the data to convert notes into numerical sequences, and normalize the data.
- Training the LSTM Model: Train an LSTM neural network to learn patterns in the music sequences.
- Generating New Music: Use the trained model to generate new music sequences based on a seed sequence.
- Saving Generated Data: Save the generated music sequences into a CSV file for further use or analysis.

* About the Dataset *
  The dataset contains the values of the music notes in an ASCII form which is further used to train the model.

* The output is generated in the form of a `.csv` file containing the values for the notes!
